## Coding language

This year I've decided to do the challenge in Typescript on NodeJS as this is the language I'm currently most comfortable with and as I want to see how fast I
can complete the challenges!

However as a learning experience I'm also planning on doing as many of the challenges in Python as well, without any pressure to complete it fast!
